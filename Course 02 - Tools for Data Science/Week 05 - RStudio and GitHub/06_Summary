A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored. 

Version control allows multiple users to work on the same codebase or repository, mirroring the codebase on their 
own computers if needed, while the distributed version control software helps manage synchronization amongst the 
various codebase mirrors.

Repositories are storage structures that:

Store the code

Track issues and changes

Enable you to collaborate with others

Git is one of the most popular distributed version control systems. 

GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket are examples of hosted version control systems.

Branches are used to isolate changes to code. When the changes are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.

Repositories can be cloned to make it possible to work locally, then sync changes back to the original.
