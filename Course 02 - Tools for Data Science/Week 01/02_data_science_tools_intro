Module 3: Packages, APIs, Data Sets and Models  
=================================================

This module will give you in-depth knowledge of different libraries, APIs, dataset sources and models used by data scientist.

Learning Objectives

+ List examples of the various libraries: scientific, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning.
+ Define REST API to request and respond.
+ Describe data sets and sources of data.
+ Explore open data sets on the Data Asset eXchange.
+ Describe how to use a learning model to solve a problem.
+ List the tasks that a data scientist needs to perform to build a model.
+ Explore ML models in the Model Learning eXchange.


Module 4: Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab 
===============================================

This module introduces the Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab. 
You will learn how to work with different kernels and the basic Jupyter architecture. 
In addition, you will identify the tools in an Anaconda Jupyter environment. 
Finally, the module overviews cloud-based Jupyter environments and their data science features. 

Learning Objectives

Module 5: RStudio and GitHub 
================================

This module will start with an introduction to R and RStudio and will end up with Github usage. 
You will learn about the different R visualization packages and how to create visual charts using the plot function.
Further in the module, you will develop the essential conceptual and hands-on skills to work with Git and GitHub. 
You will start with an overview of Git and GitHub, creating a GitHub account and a project repository, 
adding files, and committing your changes using the web interface. 
Next, you will become familiar with Git workflows involving branches, pull requests (PRs), and merges.
You will also complete a project at the end to apply and demonstrate your newly acquired skills. 

Learning Objectives

+ Describe R capabilities and RStudio environment.
+ Use the inbuilt R plot function.
+ Explain version control and describe the Git and GitHub environment.
+ Describe the purpose of source repositories and explain how GitHub satisfies the needs of a source repository.
+ Create a GitHub account and a project repository.
+ Demonstrate how to edit and upload files in GitHub.
+ Explain the purpose of branches and how to merge changes.


Module 6: Final Project and Assessment  
=========================================

In this module, you will work on a final project to demonstrate some of the skills learned in the course. 
You will also be tested on your knowledge of various components and tools in a Data Scientist's toolkit 
learned in the previous modules.

Learning Objectives

+ Create a Jupyter Notebook with markdown and code cells
+ List examples of languages, libraries and tools used in Data Science
+ Share your Jupyter Notebook publicly on GitHub
+ Evaluate notebooks submitted by your peers using the provided rubric
+ Demonstrate proficiency in Data Science toolkit knowledge



Module7: IBM Watson Studio 
=================================

This is as an optional module if you are interested in learning about and working with data science tools 
from IBM such as  Watson Studio.

Learning Objectives
+ Find common resources in Watson Studio and IBM Cloud Pak for Data.
+ Create an IBM Cloud account, service, and project in Watson Studio.
+ Create and share a Jupyter Notebook.
+ Use different types of Jupyter Notebook templates and kernels on IBM Watson Studio.
+ Describe how to connect a Watson Studio account and publish a notebook in GitHub.
