Module 4 Summary
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:

Jupyter Notebooks are used in Data Science for recording experiments and projects.

Jupyter Lab is compatible with many files and Data Science languages.

There are different ways to install and use Jupyter Notebooks.

How to run, delete, and insert a code cell in Jupyter Notebooks.

How to run multiple notebooks at the same time.

How to present a notebook using a combination of Markdown and code cells.

How to shut down your notebook sessions after you have completed your work on them.

The Anaconda Navigator GUI can launch multiple applications on a local device.

Jupyter environments in the Anaconda Navigator include JupyterLab and VS Code.

You can download Jupyter environments separately from the Anaconda Navigator, but they may not be configured properly.
