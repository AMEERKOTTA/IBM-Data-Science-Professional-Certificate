Foundations of Data Science
===========================

+ Data Analysis is not new.
+ What is new is Analysing Large Amount of Data.
+ like log files, patient information files, emails, sports data, 
	social media data, sensor data, sales data, security camera data and more.
+ Now we have computing power to Analyze the Data.
+ So Data Science can help organizations to 

	* Understand their Environments.
	* Analyze Existing Issues.
	* Reveal Previously Hidden Opportunities.

+ Steps to a Data Science Project

	* Clarify the Business Question.
	* What is the Data to Solve the Problem.
	* From where we will get the Data to Solve the Problem.

+ Data Science is Changing 

	* The way we Work
	* The way we use Data
	* Our Approach to the World.



SUMMARY
=======

+ Data science is the study of large quantities of data, 
  which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.

+ There are  many paths to a career in data science; most, 
  but not all, involve a little math, a little science, and a lot of curiosity about data.

+ New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.
