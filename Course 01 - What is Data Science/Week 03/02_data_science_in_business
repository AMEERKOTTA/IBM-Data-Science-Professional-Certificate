The ultimate purpose of analytics is to communicate findings to the concerned who might use 
these insights to formulate policy or strategy. Analytics summarize findings in tables and plots. 
The data scientist should then use the insights to build the narrative to communicate the findings. 
In academia, the final deliverable is in the form of essays and reports. 
Such deliverables are usually 1,000 to 7,000 words in length.


In consulting and business, the final deliverable takes on several forms. 
It can be a small document of fewer than 1,500 words illustrated with tables and plots, 
or it could be a comprehensive document comprising several hundred pages. 
Large consulting firms, such as McKinsey and Deloitte,
I routinely generate analytics-driven reports to communicate their findings and, in the process, 
establish their expertise in specific knowledge domains.
