Regular expressions (RegEx) are patterns used to match and manipulate strings of text. There are several special sequences in RegEx that can be used to match specific characters or patterns.

Special Sequence	Meaning	Example
\d	Matches any digit character (0-9)	"123" matches "\d\d\d"
\D	Matches any non-digit character	"hello" matches "\D\D\D\D\D"
\w	Matches any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _)	"hello_world" matches "\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w"
\W	Matches any non-word character	"@#$%" matches "\W\W\W\W"
\s	Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.)	"hello world" matches "\w\s\w\w\w\w\w"
\S	Matches any non-whitespace character	"hello_world" matches "\S\S\S\S\S\S\S\S\S"
\b	Matches the boundary between a word character and a non-word character	"cat" matches "\bcat\b" in "The cat sat on the mat"
\B	Matches any position that is not a word boundary	"cat" matches "\Bcat\B" in "category" but not in "The cat sat on the mat"
