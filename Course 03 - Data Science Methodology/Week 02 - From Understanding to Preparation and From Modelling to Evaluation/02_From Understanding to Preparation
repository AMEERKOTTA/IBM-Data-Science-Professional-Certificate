From Understanding to Preparation
=================================

Descriptive Statistics :
========================
    + Univariate Statistics
    + Pairwise Correlations 
    + Histograms
    
Histograms are a good way to understand how values or a variable are distributed,
and what sort of Data Preparation may be needed to make the Variable more Useful in a Model.


Data Quality Check :
====================
    + Missing Values
    + Invalid or Misleading Values.
    
DATA COLLECTION IS AN ITERATIVE PROCESS

Data Preparation :
==================
    + Data Preparation is one of the Most Important and Time Consuming Taks in Data Science Project.
    + It will take 70-90% of the time to Prepare and Finalize the Data which needs to be Used in the Model.
    
Feature Engineering :
=====================
    + Process of using domain knowledge of data to create features that makes the ML algorithms works.
    + Feature Engineering is critical when ML tools are being applied to analyze the data.
