============================

+ Data Modelling is developing either Predictive or Descriptive Models.
+ Data Modelling needs Training Sets and Test Sets.

================

  + The process of iterative evaluation of the model.
  + To check whether we are getting desired output.
  + And to Understand whether we need a tweak in the present model.
